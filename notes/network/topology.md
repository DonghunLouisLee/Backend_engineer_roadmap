network topology overview 

# Summary

network topology: physical and logical network layout

physical: actual layout of the computer cables and other network devices
logical: the way in which the network appears to the devices that use it

## Bus topology

1. Uses a trunk or backbone to which all of the computers on the network connect.
2. Systems connect to this backbone using T connectors or taps.

장점: 저렴하고 구축하기 쉽다.  
단점: 중앙 케이블이 끊어지면 모든 통신이 끊긴다.

## Ring topology

1. data travels in circular fashion from one computer to another on the network. ex)Typically FDDI, SONET or Token Ring
technology are used to implement a ring network

2. Ring networks are most commonly wired in a
star configuration

3. Token Ring has multi-station access unit
(MSAU),equivalent to hub or switch. MSAU
performs the token circulation internally.
